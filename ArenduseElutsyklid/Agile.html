           <p>Agile development focuses on creating working software quickly, 
            collaborating with customers frequently, and being able to adapt to changes easily. 
            This methodology is especially beneficial for projects that are complex or have uncertain requirements.</p>
            <p> The four Agile values give you an inside look at what the methodology is founded upon:

                Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
                Working software over comprehensive documentation
                Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
                Responding to change by following a plan
